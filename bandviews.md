Artists and Advertisers can benefit from the relationship Nex Level Media Ltd. has with the BandViews platform as a Partner. 

Artists
=======
For Artists, the most important aspects of the platform will be to expand your recognition across the region whilst adding a new revenue stream from the practice sessions you're already running. Nex Level Media Ltd. can help you best understand the right content, timing, messaging and performance needs to help you maximise the revenue you can earn from participation. At the same time we can help expand your fanbase by directly promoting your latest sessions and material through the BandViews media platform and marketing teams.

For new Artists, the oppportunity is even greater - you'll have access to millions of fans across the globe that are already logging onto the site to watch performances of their favourite band. Your material will be displayed alongside some of the biggest acts in the region. As more fans become aware of your music, they can vote you to the top and give you the chance to get your own recording contract.  You're probably paying money to practice in a recording studio - why not put that time to better use and try to get yourself seen?

Advertisers
===========
For Advertisers, our concept is simple. We have many talented artists logging on to the BandViews site, displaying their content for the fans to see. Through the platform we have a strong understanding of the nature of these fans: where they're from, what brands they like, who their friends are ... and in some cases contact details so your direct marketing arm can reach out and connect.

For established acts we can directly introduce you to both the Artist and the BandViews platform, arranging a promotional session tailored to your particular brand requirements. Through sponsorship of the Artist and the recording session you'll be able to get your brand noticed by the fans you want to target at the exact moment you need to connect with them.
