Nex Level Media Ltd. aims to provide exposure and additional revenue earning streams to artists in the South East Asian region, whilst offering both local and global companies the opportunity to target their brands to an increasingly affluent local demographic. 

**Artists** can use our relationship with the BandViews platform to showcase their newest content and engage their audience during practice sessions. 

For established artists this provides a unique opportunity to leverage their practice performances and return additional revenue streams to supplement their income. It also enables greater fan engagement, feedback on the newest material before release, and an ability to expand into new markets across the globe.

For new artists the platform enables their content to be viewed by a wider audience, also giving valuable fan feeback on performance quality and song selections. The biggest opportunity is the chance to be discovered by a major record label, taking your band to the big-time.

If you're interested in learning more, please contact our dedicated support team (<contact@nexlevel.media>) for more information.
